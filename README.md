# Email-Excel-Sender
Simple email sender, reads addresses from an Excel file, the body of the email is taken from a text file.

This was made in an occasion I needed something like this and just thought it was faster to make it myself than to search it. 
I'm now using it as an example for my next python course to show how python can be used to help yourself on everyday (or so) tasks.
